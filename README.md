# Twin Prime Checker

## Overview

The **Twin Prime Checker** is a C program designed to find and display twin prime numbers within a specified range. Twin primes are pairs of prime numbers that have a difference of 2 (e.g., 11 and 13, or 17 and 19). This program provides a command-line interface for users to input the range and then identifies and prints twin prime pairs within that range.

## Features

- Input validation for user-defined number ranges.
- Utilizes standard C libraries for mathematical operations and input/output.
- Displays twin prime pairs within the specified range.

## Getting Started

 ### Prerequisites

    - A C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile the source code.
    - Basic familiarity with the C programming language.

### Installation and Compilation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/karaolos9/TwinPrimesC.git

 ### Program Compilation
- C compilation using the gcc command (gcc twinPrimes.c -o twinPrimes -lm)

## Usage
1. Run the Program
Execute the compiled program:
./twinPrimes

2. Input Number Range
When prompted, enter the lower and upper bounds of the range within which you want to find twin prime pairs.

3. View Results
The program will display the twin prime pairs found within the specified range.

4. Exit the Program
After viewing the results, press any key to exit the program.

## Requirements
-C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
-C Standard Library
-Math Library (linked with -lm)

## Example

$ ./twinPrimes
Enter your number: 10
Enter your number: 50
11 and 13 are twin primes
17 and 19 are twin primes
29 and 31 are twin primes
41 and 43 are twin primes
Press any key to exit:
